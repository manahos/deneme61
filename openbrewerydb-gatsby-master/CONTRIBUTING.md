## Pull Request

After you've created a branch on your fork with your changes, it's time to [make a pull request][pr-link]!

Once you‚Äôve submitted a pull request, the collaborators can review your proposed changes and decide whether or not to incorporate (pull in) your changes.

### Pull Request Pro Tips

* [Fork][fork-link] the repository and [clone][clone-link] it locally.
Connect your local repository to the original `upstream` repository by adding it as a [remote][remote-link].
Pull in changes from `upstream` often so that you stay up to date and so when you submit your pull request,
merge conflicts will be less likely. See more detailed instructions [here][syncing-link].
* Create a [branch][branch-link] for your edits.
* Contribute in the style of the project (TODO: Create guidelines). This makes it easier for the collaborators to merge
and for others to understand and maintain in the future.
* Please try to squash all commits together before opening a pull request, but it's not currently required. If your pull request requires changes upon review, and you're already in the habit, please squash all additional commits as well. [This wiki page][squash-link] outlines the squash process.

### Open Pull Requests

Once you‚Äôve opened a pull request, a discussion will start around your proposed changes.

Other contributors and users may chime in, but ultimately the decision is made by the collaborators.

During the discussion, you may be asked to make some changes to your pull request.

If so, add more commits to your branch and push them ‚Äì they will automatically go into the existing pull request!

Opening a pull request will trigger a Github Action build to check the validity of all links in the project. After the build completes, **please ensure that the build has passed**. If the build did not pass, please view the Github Action log and correct any errors that were found in your contribution. 

Thanks for being a part of this project, and we look forward to hearing from you soon! üçª
