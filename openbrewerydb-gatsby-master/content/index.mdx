## About

Open Brewery DB is a free API for public information on breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops. Currently it is focused to the United States, but future plans are to import world-wide data.

## Why

I like craft breweries. I particularly like those which allow my dog, are open during the day, and have WiFi so I can work remote with my best buddy. While there are other websites and resources available, none had an easy-to-use, publically-accessible API.

The goal of this project is to keep an up-to-date, curated, and publically available database of breweries for the betterment of the beer community and joy of web developers like myself.

Cheers! üçª
